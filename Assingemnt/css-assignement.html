            <h2>Q-1. What are the benefits of using CSS ?</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet that provides a set of style rules for defining the layout
                of HTML documents. By using CSS, you can control the colour of the text, style of fonts, spacing between
                paragraphs, size and layout of columns, background images as well as a variety of other effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a type of style sheet language that give web designers control over how
                an internet site interacts with web browsers, including how its HTML documents are formatted and
                displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key objective was to distinguish between the content of documents and their presentation, which
                includes design elements like colour, layout, and fonts. The design and aesthetics of an internet page
                are handled by CSS. You can adjust the text's colour, font style, paragraph spacing, column size and
                layout, among other things, by using CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS gives instructions to HTML on how to display a website so that users may see it. Let's take a quick
                look at CSS's advantages and disadvantages.
            </p>

            <h3>Advantage of css *</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With CSS, you only need to declare a repeating style for an element once and use it repeatedly
                    because CSS will automatically apply the necessary styles.
                </li>

                <li>
                    CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element
                    once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Devices can easily read CSS updates. There is a need for responsive web design because consumers use
                    a wide variety of smart devices to visit websites online.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It reduces the file transfer size.

                </li>

            <h2>Q-2. What are the disadvantages of CSS ?</h2>
            <h3>Disadvantage of Css</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CSS, from CSS 1 to CSS3, causes misunderstanding among web browsers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The availability of security is limited.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If any compatibility issues arise after making the changes, we must verify them. All browsers are
                    affected by the same change.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The world of programming languages is challenging for novices and those who are not developers.
                    Different CSS levels, such as CSS, CSS 2, and CSS 3, can be very confusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When utilising CSS, cross-browser difficulties could arise.

            <h2>Q-3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3 ?</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheet: CSS stands for this term. Its primary goal is to give the website some flair and
                fashion. Colour, layout, background, font, and border properties are available in CSS. Better content
                accessibility, increased flexibility and control, as well as the ability to specify presentational
                attributes, are all made possible by CSS features
            </p>
            <p>
                ascading Style Sheet Level 3 is known as CSS3, and it is the most recent version of CSS. It is utilised
                to format, style, and organise websites. All current web browsers support CSS3, which has a number of
                new capabilities. The division of CSS standards into discrete modules that are easier to understand and
                use is CSS3's most significant feature.

            <h2>Q.4 Name a few CSS style components ?</h2>
            <p>The style of web pages using HTML elements is set using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It alters the
                properties of several web page elements, such as the background colour, font size, font family, colour,
                etc.</p>

            <p>The following list of three CSS types includes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inline Css</li>
                <li>Emabed Css</li>
                <li>External Css</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Inline CSS:</b> Inline CSS is a style sheet that includes a CSS property in the body of an element.
                The style attribute of an HTML tag is used to specify this kind of style.</p>
            <p><b>Emabes Css:</b>When a single HTML document needs to be styled uniquely, internal or
                embedded CSS might be employed. The head part of the HTML document should contain the CSS rule set,
                which is done by embedding the CSS within the style> tag.</p>
            <p><b>External Css:</b>External CSS consists of independent CSS files that, with the aid of tag attributes
                (such as class, id, heading,... etc.), only include style characteristics. CSS properties should be
                linked to the HTML content using a link tag and are written in a separate file with a.css extension. It
                implies that a style can only be set once per element and will be used consistently throughout web</p>

            <p>
                Use the style attribute and the CSS property background-color inside the body tag of the HTML document

            <p>
                Because HTML5 does not support the bgcolor attribute of the body> tag, background colour is added using

                using CSS, the background-attachment property is used to define the nature of the background image's
                attachment to its container. You can choose to keep it fixed or scroll it. It is applicable to every
                HTML element.</p>

            <h3>Syntax:</h3>
            <div class="viz-2">
                background-attachment: scroll|fixed|local|initial|inherit;
            </div>

            <p><b>Example 1:</b> The background-attachment property of CSS's next example shows the "scroll" value in
                action. Also scrolled is the background-attachment image.</p>

            <p>
                This post will demonstrate how to use CSS to centre elements at the block level.
            </p>

            <p>
                A block-level element can be centred in two different ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                We need to define the external width in the first step. Since block-level items have a width of 100% of
                the page by default, we need room around them in order to centre them. Therefore, we are providing the
                space a width in order to create it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Step 2: Set the element's left-margin and right-margin to auto. Since we created a residual space by
                providing external width, we should use the margin attribute to appropriately align that area. A
                property called margin instructs how to align a vacant area. So for

            <p>With the introduction of CSS3, the CSS Specification is the same, but it now takes a different
                approach.The Specification provides extensive algorithms, code snippets, and tabular data in addition to
                defining how CSS attributes should be implemented by browser vendors.</p>
            <h3>Additionally, the specification contains:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The language's grammar and data types</li>
                <li>Explanation of CSS Selectors in detail</li>
                <li>the process for putting values on attributes</li>
                <li>The Cascade (CSS's "C").</li>
                <li>The process of inheritance</li>
                <li>e.g., The Box Model</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Some of these topics are briefly and simply presented, while others are explained in considerable length.
            </p>
            <p>The Specification also outlines how to target particular media, such as print or screen, and how
                stylesheets can be incorporated into your web publication.</p>

            <p>The CSS specification before CSS3 was a single specification, whereas CSS3 is divided into modules, which
                are independent specifications that can be worked on by different author(s) at different speeds. For
                example, we have selector level 3 specification, CSS colour 4, CSS backgrounds, and so on. All of these
                modules are under the CSS3 umbrella, however some are updates to CSS2.1 and some are brand-new.

            <h2>Q.13 What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h2>

            <h3>1. Inline-Style</h3>
            <p>The first way to incorporate CSS into HTML is using a technique known as inline-styling. When CSS rules
                are added directly into HTML elements (tags), this is referred to as inline styling.</p>

            <p>For instance, suppose I want to alter an element's text colour:</p>

            <div class="viz-0">
                &lt;h1 <b>style</b>="color: red"&gt;Test Headline&lt;/h1&gt;
            </div>

            <p>The new rule (in this case, text colour) will then be applied to the h1 element:</p>

            <div class="viz1">
                <h1 style="color: blue">Test Headline</h1>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Internal CSS</h3>

            <p>The internal CSS method is the second approach to include CSS in HTML. This method requires the usage of
                an HTML tag called "style" (not "style attribute"), between which we can place our CSS selectors and
                rules:
            </p>

            <div class="box8">
                <b>&lt;style&gt;</b><br>
                h1 { <br>
                color: red;<br>
                }<br>
                <b>&lt;/style&gt;</b><br>
                &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &lt;h1>Test Headline&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                &lt;/body&gt;<br>
            </div>

            <div class="viz1">
                <h1 style="color:blue">Test Headline</h1>
            </div>

            <h3>3. External CSS</h3>

            <p>The ideal practise is to keep HTML and CSS separate. In actual programming, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                must all be kept in distinct files and imported as needed. This method facilitates code maintenance and
                enhances readability.
            </p>

            <p>To employ this method, we must first create individual CSS files with the.css extension and then connect
                them to HTML.
            </p>

            <p>We could, for instance, make a CSS file called index.css. Our CSS rules are written in the index.css
                file:
            </p>

            <div class="viz2">
                h1 { <br>
                color: red; <br>
                } <br>
            </div>

            <p>Then we can import index.css to HTML with a &lt;link&gt; tag like below:</p>

            <div class="viz3">
                &lt;head&gt; <br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css"&gt; <br>
                &lt;/head&gt;<br>
                &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &lt;h1&gt; Test Headline &lt;/h1><br>
                &lt;/body&gt;<br>
            </div>

            <p>And the rules are again applied successfully:</p>

            <div class="viz1">
                <h1 style="color: blue">Test Headline</h1>
            </div>

                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/head&gt;<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;External Styles&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p id="intro"&gt;Allow you to define styles for the whole

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p class="colorful"&gt;This has a style applied via a
                class.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br>

        <h2>Q.16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h2>

        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of CSS</h3>

        <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a type of style sheet language that give web designers control over how
            an internet site interacts with web browsers, including how its HTML documents are formatted and
            displayed.</p>

        <p>CSS, often known as cascading sheets, is a text-based coding language that describes how websites are
            formatted and how they interact with web browsers. The language enables web designers to control a wide
            range of style features, including layout, colour, and fonts, which in turn affects how HTML documents
            are formatted and displayed.</p>

        <h3>Advantages of CSS:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>With CSS, you only need to declare a repeating style for an element once and use it repeatedly
                because CSS will automatically apply the necessary styles.</li>
            <li>The primary benefit of CSS is that it applies style uniformly across various websites. Multiple
                locations can be controlled by a single instruction, which is beneficial.</li>
            <li>For each page, web designers should add a few lines of programming to increase site speed.</li>
            <li>Because a change to one line of code impacts the entire website and maintenance time, cascading
                sheets simplify both website construction and maintenance.</li>
            <li>Because it is less complicated, the effort is drastically decreased.</li>
            <li>Changes that are consistent and spontaneous are formed.</li>
            <li>Devices can easily read CSS updates. There is a need for responsive web design because consumers use
                a wide variety of smart devices to visit websites online.</li>
            <li>It is capable of shifting position. It assists us in figuring out how the positions of the web
                elements that are present on the page have changed.</li>
            <li>These significant values of inconsequential tags that blend in with a jumble of pages represent the
                bandwidth savings.</li>
            <li>The user can easily customise the online page</li>
            <li>It lessens the size of the file transfer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages of CSS:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>CSS, from CSS 1 to CSS3, causes misunderstanding among web browsers.</li>
            <li>What works with one browser may not always work with another when it comes to CSS. The programme
                must be tested for compatibility by web developers using a variety of browsers.</li>
            <li>The availability of security is limited.</li>
            <li>If any compatibility issues arise after making the changes, we must verify them. All browsers are
                affected by the same change.</li>
            <li>The world of programming languages is challenging for novices and those who are not developers.
                Different CSS levels, such as CSS, CSS 2, and CSS 3, can be very confusing.</li>
            <li>compatibility with various browsers (some support styles sheets, while others do not).</li>
            <li>On various browsers, CSS functions differently. CSS is supported in different ways by IE and Opera.
            </li>
            <li>When utilising CSS, cross-browser difficulties could arise.</li>
            <li>Confusion is brought on by the several tiers, which are confusing to newbies and non-developers.
            </li>

        <h2>Q.17 What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h2>

        <p>The collection of characters and special symbols known as CSS selectors tells the browser which CSS
            properties should be applied to which HTML element. CSS selectors employ the HTML element's attributes,
            class name, kind of tag (such as header, div, etc.), and id name (which starts with #) to choose which
            ones to select. The subject of the selector is the HTML element(s) that the selector has chosen.
        </p>

        <p>To "find" (or choose) the HTML components you want to style, CSS selectors are employed.</p>

        <p>CSS selectors can be categorised into one of five groups:</p>


        <ul style="margin: 4vmin 0 4vmin 5vmin;">
            <li>Select components using <b>simple selectors</b> (based on name, id, and class)</li>
            <li>Combinator selectors</b> (which choose elements based on how closely they are related to one
                another)</li>
            <li>Elements can be chosen using <b>pseudo-class selectors</b> based on a specific state.</li>
            <li>Selecting and styling <b>pseudo-elements</b> (a portion of an element)</li>
            <li>Elements can be chosen based on an attribute or attribute value using <b>attribute selectors.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We'll go over the most fundamental CSS selectors on this page.</p>

        <h2>Q.18 What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h2>

        <h3>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries</h3>

        <p>CSS3's media queries expanded on the concept of media types introduced in CSS2 by looking at a device's
            capabilities rather than its type.
        </p>

        <p>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Viewport dimensions: width and height</li>
            <li>Device dimensions: width and height</li>
            <li>The tablet or phone's orientation—is it in landscape or portrait mode?
                resolution</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A common method for distributing a customised style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile
            phones (such as iPhone and Android phones) is to use media queries. </p>

        <h3>Media Query Syntax</h3>
        <p>A media type and one or more expressions that can resolve to true or false make up a media query.</p>

        <div class="viz4">
            @media not|only mediatype and (expressions) { <br>
            &nbsp;CSS-Code; <br>
            } <br>
        </div>

        <p>If the media type supplied matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all of the
            media query's expressions are true, the result of the query is true. A media query that returns true
            applies the associated style sheet or style rules in accordance with the standard cascade rules.</p>

        <p>The media type is optional, and the all type will be presumed unless the not or only operators are used.
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, you can use various stylesheets for various media:</p>

        <div class="viz">
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="mediatype and|not|only (expressions)" href="print.css"&gt;
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin: 5vmin 0;">CSS3 Media Types</h3>

        <center>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>all</td>
                    <td>Used for all media type devices</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>print</td>
                    <td>Used for printers</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>screen</td>
                    <td>Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>speech</td>
                    <td>Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </center>

        <h3>Media Queries Simple Examples</h3>

        <p>Including an alternative CSS section right inside your style sheet is one approach to leverage media
            queries.</p>

        <p>The background colour in the example below is changed to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or
            more (pink if the viewport is less than 480 pixels wide):</p>

        <div class="box01">
            @media screen and (min-width: 480px) {<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; body {<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;background-color: lightgreen;<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
            } <br>
        </div>
        <!-- == Question-18 End == -->
        <!-- == Question-19 Start == -->
        <div class="question-19">

            <h2>Q.19 What is the rule set?</h2>

            <p>Multiple affirmations to various parts or sections of the document make up a CSS ruleset. The goal is to
                apply a number of characteristics for various distinct qualities to a single component or specific group
                of components in the associated HTML page. </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5vmin;">Visualization of CSS Ruleset :</h3>

            <center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210818153202/CSSrulesetImage.png"
                    alt="" width="550px"></center>

            <p style="margin-top: 5vmin;">In addition to "container" indicating the name of the selector, the "." at the
                beginning denotes that the rule defined will be a class. In a declaration block, which contains some CSS
                properties and their corresponding values, "first-child" similarly denotes the pseudo-class, and items
                enclosed in curly brackets are declaration block elements. When the selector name is called on the main
                HTML page, the CSS ruleset will be applied.</p>

            <p>The foundation of the CSS stylesheet is the CSS Ruleset.</p>
