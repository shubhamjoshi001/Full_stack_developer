        <p>
            HTML,DOM which displays a Html document as a tree documents simple to read and alter. A Document object is
            created when an HTML file is loaded in a browser window. You can use the document.createElement() method to
            dynamically create a specific HTML element in JavaScript. After creation, attributes can be added. You must
            put the element into the document's DOM-tree if you want it to appear in the document.

        <h2>Q.10 How to read and write a file using JavaScript? </h2>
        <p>
            File reading and writing are not supported on the client side by JavaScript browsers. The Node.js fs module
            can be used for this on the server-side. It has techniques for reading and writing files on the file system
            that are both synchronous and asynchronous. Several examples of the node.js fs module reading and writing
            files will be displayed.

            To read and write files, utilize Javascript's fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() APIs. The file is read via an
            internal technique called fs.readFile(). This approach reads the entire file into memory and stores it in a
            buffer.

        <h2>Q.11=> What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? </h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>in loop</li>
            <li>During loop</li>
            <li>Loop while doing</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">For Loop Statement</h3>
        <p>
            When a loop is used, it performs the three specified tasks (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3) a fixed
            number of times. The general syntax of the "for" statement is demonstrated in the following code.

            Syntax:
            for (initialization; condition; increment/ decrement){
            Executed these statements;
            }
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">While Loop Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Of all looping statements, the while one is the most straightforward. While a particular condition is true,
            a block of code is repeated in a while loop. The three distinct jobs have been carried out in the for loop.
            The same three specific activities are carried out in the while loop as well as where it is mentioned in the
            statement, but the initialization and conditions of the while loop take place in various locations. The code
            below demonstrates the while statement's basic syntax:

            Syntax:
            while (condition)
            {
            Execute these statements; //true
            Increment/decrement;
            }
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">do-while Statement</h3>
        <p>
            The while statement and the do-while statement are related. The condition is present outside the statement
            in the do-while construct. If the condition is not met, it will still run at least once. If the condition is
            true, the code will continue to run; if the condition is false, the code will cease running. The general
            syntax of the while statement is shown in the following code:

            Syntax:
            do
            {
            Execute the statements;
            Increment/decrements;
            }
            while (condition) //true
        </p>

    <div class="Question-12">
        <h2> Q.12=> How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript uses the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) functions to convert a string to an
            integer. When the string doesn't contain a number, the parseInt() function returns NaN (not a number). Only
            the specified number will be returned if a string containing a number is given. Spaces are not permitted in
            this function. If a specific number is supplied with spaces, the portion of the number that appears before
            the space is returned as the output.

        <h2> Q,13=>What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript Array delete()

            Array elements can be deleted using the JavaScript operator delete . Using delete leaves undefined holes in
            the array. Use pop() or shift() instead.

    <div class="Question-14">
        <h2>Q.14=> What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
        <h3> javascript supports three different forms of pop-up boxes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Alert</li>
            <li>Conform</li>
            <li>prompt</li>

    </div>
    <div class="Question-15">
        <h2>Q.15=>What is the use of Void (0)? </h2>
        <p>
            javascript:void(0) may have occasionally appeared in an HTML document. It is frequently used when adding an
            expression to a web page can have unintended consequences. The command javascript:void(0) is used to reverse
            this effect. This expression yields a primitive value that is undefinable. This is frequently applied to
            hyperlinks. You may occasionally choose to execute some JavaScript from a link. Depending on the URL
            provided, the browser typically loads a fresh copy of the current page when you click a link. But if you've
            connected some JavaScript thereto link, you probably don't want this to happen. Using void(0) would stop the
            page from refreshing.

    <div class="Question-16">
        <h2>Q.16=>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            In this post, we'll look at how JavaScript can be used to compel one page to load another.

            Approach: To forcefully load another page in Javascript, we can use the window.location attribute inside the
            script element. It is a pointer to a Location object, which stands in for the document's current location.
            By visiting a window, we can modify its URL.
            script
            window.location = <Path / URL>
                script
        </p>

    <div class="Question-17">
        <h2>Q.17=>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? </h2>
        <p>
            Step The Document Object Model (DOM)'s innerHTML attribute is used to set or return an element's HTML
            content. where the textual content of the HTML element is represented by the return value. It enables
            JavaScript code to alter a website that is currently being shown. More specifically, it alters or restores
            an element's internal HTML information. Since it is the simplest approach to manipulate DOM, the innerHTML
            property is frequently used to alter the contents of webpages. But utilizing innerHTML in JavaScript has
            several drawbacks.

            Using JavaScript's innerHTML property has the following drawbacks:
            The process of employing innerHTML is more slower since its contents are constructed gradually and because
            previously parsed elements and contents must be re-parsed, which takes time.

            keeps any DOM element's event handlers in tact: The new elements produced by automatically setting innerHTML
            do not acquire event handlers. To do this, one must manually attach the event handlers to new elements and
            maintain track of the event handlers. On some browsers, this can result in a memory leak.

            All content has been changed: When you use innerHTML to add, append, delete, or edit material on a webpage,
            all of the content and any DOM nodes inside that element are replaced and recreated.

            InnerHTML appending is not supported: In JavaScript, adding is often done with the += operator. However,
            when using innerHTML to append to an HTML tag, the entire tag is re-parsed.
