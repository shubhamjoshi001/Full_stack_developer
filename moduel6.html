            <h2> Q.1 Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks</h2>
            <p> In this tutorial, we'll look at the lifecycle of a React component. A component's lifecycle begins with
                its initialization and ends when it is unmounted from the DOM. We will also go through each phase
                briefly.
            </p>

            <h3>Lifecycle of Components</h3>
            <p> Every React Component has its own lifecycle. A component's lifecycle can be defined as a collection of
                functions that are invoked at various stages of the component's existence. The definition is simple, but
                what do we mean by different stages? A React Component can go through the four stages listed below.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Initialization: This is the stage at which the component is built with the specified Props and
                    default state. This is done in a Component Class's constructor.
                </li>
                <li> Mounting: This is the stage in which the JSX returned by the render function is rendered.
                </li>
                <li> Updating: Updating is the stage in which a component's state is updated and the application is
                    repainted.
                </li>
                <li> Unmounting: As the name implies, this is the final step of the component lifecycle in which the
                    component is removed off the page.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p> React provides developers with a collection of preset functions that, if present, are invoked around
                specific events during the component's lifespan. Developers are expected to override the functions with
                necessary logic for them to operate properly. The gist is depicted in the diagram below.
            </p>

            <h3>Functions of each Lifecycle Phase:</h3>

            <h3> Initialization </h3>

            <p> The developer must define the props and initial state of the component during this step, which is often
                done in the component's constructor. The initialization procedure is described in the following code
                snippet.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-code">
                    <code>
                      class Clock extends React.Component { <br />
                      constructor(props) <br />
                      { <br />
                      // Calling the constructor of <br />
                      // Parent Class React.Component <br />
                      super(props); <br />
                      <br />
                      // Setting the initial state <br />
                      this.state = { date : new Date() }; <br />
                      } <br />
                      } <br />
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3> Mounting </h3>
            <p>Mounting is the step of the component lifecycle in which the component's initialization is done and the
                component is mounted on the DOM for the first time on the webpage. Now, React follows a default approach
                in the Naming Conventions of these predefined functions, where functions containing "Will" indicate
                before some specified phase and functions containing "Did" represent after that phase is completed. The
                mounting phase is made up of two such specified functions, which are explained below.
            </p>

            <p>In the constructor, first initialize the data and states.</p>
            <p> <strong>componentDidMount() Function:</strong> This function is called immediately after the component
                is mounted on the DOM, i.e. after the render() function is called for the first time.
            </p>

            <h3>Updation </h3>

            <p> React is a JS package that makes it simple to develop Active web pages. Active web pages are now
                specific pages that respond to their user. Take, for example, the GeeksforGeeks IDE webpage; the webpage
                behaves differently with each user. User A could be writing C code in the Light Theme while another User
                is writing Python code in the Dark Theme. This dynamic behavior, which is largely dependent on the user,
                distinguishes the webpage as an Active webpage. How does this relate to updating? Updating is the
                process of updating a component's states and properties, which is followed by user activities like as
                clicking, pushing a key on the keyboard, and so on.The following are descriptions of functions that are
                called at various points during the Updation phase.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> <strong>getDerivedStateFromProps:</strong> The static method getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
                    is called shortly before the render() method in both the mounting and updating phases of React. It
                    takes as arguments updated props and the current state.
                </li>

                <div class="example">
                    <div class="example-code">
                        <code>
                          static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {<br />
                          if(props.name !== state.name){<br />
                          //Change in props<br />
                          return{<br />
                          name: props.name<br />
                          };<br />
                          }<br />
                          return null; // No change to state<br />
                          }<br />
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p> <strong>setState() Function:</strong> This is not a Lifecycle function and can be called explicitly
                    at any time. This function is used to update a component's state. For further details, please see
                    this article.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>shouldComponentUpdate() Function:</strong> By default, every state or props update
                    re-renders the page, however this is not always wanted; sometimes it is preferred that updating the
                    page does not re-paint the page. The shouldComponentUpdate() function satisfies the requirement by
                    informing React whether or not the component's output will be affected by the update. When new
                    properties or states are received, shouldComponentUpdate() is called before rendering an already
                    mounted component. If returned false, the further rendering stages will be skipped. This function
                    cannot be used in conjunction with forceUpdate(). The Function accepts the new Props and State as
                    arguments and returns whether or not to re-render.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>function getSnapshotBeforeUpdate():</strong> The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() function is
                    called shortly before the DOM is rendered. It is used to save the previous state values once the DOM
                    is modified.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>componentDidUpdate() Function:</strong> Similarly, this function is invoked after the
                    component is rerendered, i.e. after the render() function is executed following the update of State
                    or Props.
                </p>


                <p><b>Unmounting</b></p>

                <p> This is the final phase of the component's lifespan, in which the component is unmounted from the
                    DOM. This phase's single member is the following function.
                </p>

                <li> <strong>componentWillUnmount() Function:</strong> This function is called before the component is
                    finally unmounted from the DOM, i.e. it is called once before the component is removed from the
                    page, indicating the end of the lifecycle.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p> So far, we've reviewed every predefined function in the component's lifecycle, as well as the sequence
                in which the functions were executed.
            </p>

            <h3>Putting the lifecycle methods into action</h3>

            <p> Let's look at one more example to round up the subject while refining what we've already discussed.
            </p>
            <p> To begin, create a react app and change the index.js file in the src folder.
            </p>

            <h3>index.js (source): </h3>
